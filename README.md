"# Docker-Advanced" 

docker image rm $(docker image ls -aq)
is intended to forcefully remove all Docker images on your system ‚Äî but it's written in Unix-style syntax, which won't work in PowerShell as-is.

üîç Breaking it down (Unix-style):
docker image ls -aq: Lists all image IDs, quietly (no headers).

$(...): Command substitution in Unix (bash), passes the output of the command inside.

docker image rm: Removes Docker images.

So in Linux/macOS, this removes all images:

docker image rm $(docker image ls -aq)
‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Doesn't Work in PowerShell:
PowerShell doesn‚Äôt use $(...) the same way Bash does ‚Äî so this will likely throw an error or not behave as expected.

‚úÖ PowerShell Equivalent:
In PowerShell, use this instead:

docker image ls -aq | ForEach-Object { docker image rm $_ }
